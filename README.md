# OS-Naming-Program
A program I made that automates the naming of a file based on the user's input and the file's extension type (.png, .jpg, .pdf, etc.).
You can add more by just changing the file extension names in the else if statements. 
This program is useful for those with TONS of files in a folder that need to be organized by name. 


THANKS! :)
